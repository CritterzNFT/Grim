**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Video is always useful. /grim log is required for reporting simulation falses.  Use /grim verbose and /grim log to get the debug information.  For non-simulation falses, a minimally reproducable description is best.

**Server Version:**

**Grim Version (Git commit or the version in the jar's name)**

**Relevant plugins**
Or all plugins if you are unsure
